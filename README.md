# STM32 Nucleo-G0B1RE Advanced-control Timer (TIM1) test code

This project is for testing a way to get narrow pulses from TIM1 in the STM32G0 series of microcontroller.

This refactored version is usng `OC1M[3:0] = 1101` Combined PWM mode 2 in which OC1REFC is the logical AND
between OC1REF and OC2REF.
